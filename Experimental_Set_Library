Please note: Here I include the name used in the HOL Library for easy reference. Of course, please feel free to make any modifications. I assume the style/formatting is subject to
(significant) change.



CollectI 

P a
-----------
 a ∈ {x. P x}"
 

 CollectD

 a ∈ {x. P x} 
--------------
 P a
 
QUESTION: shall we use a different format, put the statements together where the converse holds?


 Collect_cong

 (∀ x. P x = Q x) 
---------------
{x. P x} = {x. Q x}
  
  
   TIM: Should the hypothesis say P x <-> Q x rather than P x = Q x ?


set_eqI 

∀ x. (x ∈ A —> x ∈ B)
∀ x. (x ∈ B —> x ∈ A)
----------------
 A = B


(QUESTION: 
Shall we use double arrows instead of ∧?

   TIM: How do you get these mathematical symbols? 
   TIM: I think we should also have an "intermediate" expansion of set_eq, which would be that A = B if A is a subset of B and B is a subset of A.


set_eq_iff  

A = B 

------------
∀x. ((x ∈ A -> x ∈ B ) ∧ (x ∈ B -> x ∈ A))


(QUESTION: in the following, instead of a deduction, deducing that x \in A ∩ B  and vice-versa,  we have set equality. Shall we keep this format?)

   TIM: I think that for the program, deducing is more useful. That is, we rarely expand A ∩ B directly -- it is much more common to expand the statement x ∈ A ∩ B as x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B.  Oh wait, you have that below. In that case I don't think I understand your question. What would an alternative format be? 

Int_def  

A ∩ B = {x. x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B}



Alternatively:

Int_iff [simp]: 

c ∈ A ∩ B 

----------
c ∈ A ∧ c ∈ B


(QUESTION: shall we keep the above as it is or write it as two separate lemmas deducing c ∈ A and c ∈ B separately? See IntD1, IntD2.)

IntI

c ∈ A 
c ∈ B

-------------
c ∈ A ∩ B 


(The following are the analogous for unions:)

 Un_def
 
A ∪ B = {x. x ∈ A ∨ x ∈ B}
  
 Un_iff [simp]

 c ∈ A ∪ B 
-------------
 c ∈ A ∨ c ∈ B


 c ∈ A ∨ c ∈ B
------------
c ∈ A ∪ B 
 

lemma UnI1 [elim?]: 

c ∈ A

------------
 c ∈ A ∪ B
  

(QUESTION: shall we include the symmetric one below ?)
    TIM: I would recommend that we do.

lemma UnI2 [elim?]

c ∈ B

---------
 c ∈ A ∪ B
